# Nowon

What's on the radio now? What's `nowon`?

## Installation

At the moment, `nowon` requires Ruby installed and [nokogiri] as a system-level package. I should probably update that to use Bundler, but it's a thing I always have about.

Symlink it to somewhere in your path eg

	ln -s ~/src/nowon/nowon ~/bin/nowon
	
and then you can run it anywhere.

## Usage

`nowon 6music`  

`nowon radio4`

That's it.
